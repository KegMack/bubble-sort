# bubble-sort
This project is a simulator of the Bubble Sort Algorithm.  It uses jquery to use html elements to visually depict the process of the algorithm.  The user can define the size of the list, randomize the list, and start the animation.

I received information from
[sorting-algorithms.com](http://www.sorting-algorithms.com)

[wikipedia sorting algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm)

[wikipedia big-O notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation)

I also recieved help from Mel Quark on debugging some of my jquery functions.
The images used as backgrounds of my header and footer are not mine, and were found on google image search.
