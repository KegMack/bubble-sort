        <p>This page will teach you about a specific algorithm used to sort arrays of data, called the <strong>"Bubble Sort."</strong> It is an iterative process in which a piece of data is compared to it's adjacent piece.  If they are in the wrong order, they are swapped.  This process is repeated until no more swaps are made, which indicates that the sorting is complete!</p>
        <p>Sound complicated? </p>
        <p> It's actually one of the more simple sorting methods to conceptualize visually.  Here's an example: </p>
        <section id="sorting-animation">
        </section>
        <section class="button-section">
          <button id="start-button">Start Animation</button>
          <button id="randomize-button">Randomize</button>
        </section>
